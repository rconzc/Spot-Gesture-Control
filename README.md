# Spot-Gesture-Control
This page is used to collaborate and demonstrate the code related to Gesture Control with Spot that I have been working on throughout this Fall 2021 Semester for Honors Undergraduate Research at the University of Missouri - Columbia.

The code on the main branch is responsible for Gesture Detection on your local machine. I implemented this on IDLE Shell using Python version 3.9.1. Special thanks to TechVidvan for the data models of the hand gestures. I do not own the mp_hand_gestures files or the pickled data file, so if an attempt is made to further this project, it may be worth looking into creating your own hand gesture files.
