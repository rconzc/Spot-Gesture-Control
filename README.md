# Spot-Gesture-Control
This page is used to collaborate and demonstrate the code related to Gesture Control with Spot that I have been working on throughout this Fall 2021 Semester for Honors Undergraduate Research at the University of Missouri - Columbia.

This branch was used in collaboration with other Research students looking into Gesture Control. The "runspot.py" program is an example program produced by Boston Dynamics in order to assist those working with Spot. We began to transfer over the Gesture Detection code and program the Spot to perform actions based on the detected gestures. As of the time of writing this, this program is able to make Spot stand up and shut down using gestures detected by your local machine's webcam.
